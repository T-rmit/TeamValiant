  <h3>Animalcules:</h3>
  <p>Team Valiant's ‘Animalcules’ is named after the word coined by Antony van Leeuwenhoek in the 1600s; this is what he called microbes after viewing them under a microscope as they looked like animals (Willey & Sherwood & Woolverton 2011).</p>
  <p>The purpose of our project is to use technology to create a mobile application that educates users about microbiology in a fun, engaging manner. Microbiology is the study of microorganisms (also called microbes) such as bacteria, viruses and fungi that are generally too small to see unaided (Willey & Sherwood & Woolverton 2011).</p>
<p>Our proposed mobile application will be an educational game that makes use of augmented reality (AR) technology to show the user how microbes are a part of their everyday lives. The application will also act as a source of truth for the benefit of public health and dispel common myths surrounding disease.</p>
<p> The target audience for ‘Animalcules’ is anyone who has an interest in learning about microbiology. As we anticipate the majority of users will likely be primary and secondary students studying science at school, our application will aim to supplement classroom learning.</p>
<h3>Motivation:</h3>
<p> Microbiology is an interesting area of study with real-life applications. Some microbes are of benefit to our lives – they play a role in balancing the ecosystem, are used to make food products like cheese and bread, to help create vaccines, antibiotics and other medicinal products. Some microbes are even of benefit to human health, helping digest food, synthesise vitamins and assist in the development of the immune system, while other microbes have the potential to cause disease (Willey & Sherwood & Woolverton 2011).</p>

<p>Currently, microbiology has never been more relevant to our lives - the world is in the midst of a pandemic caused by an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that has resulted in some misinformation being spread.</p>

	<h3>Team Profile</h3>
	<p>For our previous individual assignments, each team member had to complete three online personality tests:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test</li>
		<li>Learning Style test</li>
		<li>A test of their own choosing</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Each team member used the MBTI test provided by the website 16Personalities and different providers for the Learning style tests.</p>

	<p>The 16Personalities’ MBTI test determines personality types by measuring five different personality aspects.</p>
 <br> These aspects are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The mind aspect (<b>I or E</b>) measures if someone is more introverted or extroverted.</li>
		<li>The energy aspect (<b> S or N </b>) measures if someone is more observant or intuitive.</li>
		<li>The nature aspect (<b> T or F </b>) measures if someone makes decisions based more on logic or emotions.</li>
		<li>The tactic aspect (<b> J or P </b>) measures if someone is more structured or flexible in their work approach.</li>
		<li>The identity aspect (<b> A or T </b>) measures how self-assured a person is.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When the aspects above are combined, a five-letter result corresponds to a particular personality type (16 Personalities 2020).</p>
	
	<p>The common result for the team is the mind aspect; all members are more introverted than extroverted. This suggests that all team members, when provided with the option, may prefer to pick individual work tasks than those that involve teamwork. This could mean as a team, we are likely to divide group tasks so that each person is working on a task individually, rather than having more than one person working together on a task.</p>
	
	<p>The team scored differently for all the other aspects – this is excellent, as diverse working styles and viewpoints can broaden the way in work is approached and completed.  Our team may brainstorm and may share different ideas for how to complete our group tasks.</p>
	
	<p>The learning style tests determine how a person best learns – whether that be through visual, auditory or kinaesthetic means. While each team member used a different learning style quiz, the results indicate that almost all the members are entirely visual learners or prefer visual learning over the other styles of learning. </p>
	
	<p>This suggests the team will be most comfortable to communicate, plan and relay information with each other in a text-based format, rather than through an online video chat or voice call.</p>
	
	<p>As the third test result is different for almost every team member, it would be unfair to single out individuals and discuss how a particular personality result would affect how the team works as a whole. However, these results could be a good point for discussion between team members to ensure everyone feels comfortable contributing, sharing and interacting together as a group.</p>

        <h3>Group Processes</h3>
        <p> Team Valiant, worked very well together when executing Assignment 2, everything was submitted on time, and with great effort. However, even the strongest of teams has their flaws and we investigated how we can fix these weaknesses for Assignment 3. We introduced more Team meetings throughout the weeks planning and constructing on how we will complete parts of the assignment. We made more of an effort to complete the assignment before the due date. Also, we took into consideration mistakes that made us lose marks in the last assignment so that can be reduced in Assignment 3. The Team hopes that by doing this we will be able to achieve a higher grade than Assignment 2. <p>

	<h3>Ideal Jobs</h3>
	<p> Table 2. Ideal jobs (and the industry they blong to) for each team member</p>
	
	<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Team Member</th>
		<th>Ideal Job</th>
		<th>Industry</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Mitchell</td>
		<td>IT Operations & Infrastructure Administrator</td>
		<td>Manufacturing</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Tim</td>
		<td>IT Manager</td>
		<td>Manufacturing</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Eenu</td>

		<td>Insurance</td>
	</tr>

	</tr>
	<tr>

		<td>Biostatistician/Data Analyst</td>
		<td>Medical Research Institute</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
	<p>When comparing and contrasting our ideal jobs, it is clear that they are all IT roles in industries that that are not primarily focused on information technology. This does not mean, however, that the businesses and organisations of our ideal jobs do not benefit.</p>
	
	<p>For instance, Wenjun’s ideal job involves data analysis that would provide the medical research team useful insight on their work. Likewise, having an IT department in almost any organisation is useful, as the right technology can assist with keeping record of useful data to identify trends, provide solutions for work to be completed more efficiently and allow businesses to be innovative. Managing an IT department to benefit the overall business is a key responsibility of Tim’s ideal job.</p>
	
	<p>An IT department (and the related business) can only be successful if the right infrastructure and software is in place, is kept up to date, and the users are supported with any difficulties they may have; these are responsibilities of the ideal jobs picked by Mitchell, Tim and Eenu. Lastly, an IT system should always be secure and safe from external threats, and that this the purpose of Tyson’s ideal job.</p>
	
	<p>Our career plans as a team will differ, as each ideal job requires a different mix of qualifications, skills and years of experience. For example, Tyson’s ideal job as a Cyber Security Analyst, is specialised and states he will need at least 5 years of experience in information security roles. In contrast, Eenu’s ideal job as an Application Support Analyst requires no experience, as it is aimed at university graduates.</p>
	
	<p>With the exception of Eenu’s ideal job, the ideal jobs chosen by the team require some prior experience and knowlege, and are indicative of having a long-term goal/career plan in place.</p>
	
	<p>The longest career plan is likely to be Tim’s, as in his ideal job as an IT Manager, he will be responsible for the multiple IT teams at the workplace and the 3-8 staff working under him. He will be required to liaise with other business units in his workplace, and will need experience and understanding of different sections of IT – infrastructure, security, data analytics, etc.</p>
	
	<p>Only Eenu and Wenjun’s ideal jobs state a degree is required, however, having a degree or educational background in IT would be useful for all our ideal jobs.</p>
